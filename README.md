# LLC1 Document API

This is the repository for the LLC1 API used to collate the information required to generate an LLC1 document.

### Documentation

At present the documentation is not hooked into any viewer within the dev environment. To edit or view the 
documentation open the YAML file in swagger.io <http://editor.swagger.io>
